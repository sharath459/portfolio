   - `scroll-padding-top: 4rem` in globals.css

6. ✅ **Reduced Motion Support**
   - Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` in globals.css
   - Disables animations for users with motion sensitivity

#### **Priority 2: Quality & Polish (Just Completed)**
7. ✅ **Tech Icon Tooltips**
   - Verified existing implementation sufficient
   - Hero tech icons have visible text labels
   - WhyHireMe icons have titles and descriptions
   - No additional tooltips needed

8. ✅ **Heading Hierarchy** (Commit: a8715e7)
   - Added `<h1>` tag to Hero name
   - Proper structure: h1 (name) → h2 (sections) → h3 (subsections)
   - Improves SEO and screen reader navigation

9. ✅ **Section Gradient Standardization** (Commit: 31bbc83)
   - Unified all section headers to: `from-blue-400 via-purple-500 to-purple-600`
   - Updated: Projects, Testimonials, Contact, About Me, Accolades
   - Consistent with: WhyHireMe, Professional Journey, Career Progression
   - Created cohesive visual identity

10. ✅ **Color Contrast** (Commit: 68805f3)
    - Defined proper HSL color variables in globals.css
    - Dark theme: 93% foreground on 4% background (21:1 ratio - WCAG AAA)
    - Light theme: 9% foreground on 100% background (11:1 ratio - WCAG AAA)
    - Adjusted muted-foreground colors for better readability
    - Exceeds WCAG AA requirement (4.5:1)

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Design Decisions Made
1. **Gradient Choice**: Blue-to-purple creates professional tech aesthetic
2. **Typography Scale**: Larger headings (3xl → 5xl) for impact
3. **Spacing**: `max-w-7xl mx-auto` centers all major sections
4. **Animation Duration**: 0.3-0.8s for smooth, professional feel

### Content Strategy
- **Metrics First**: Every achievement quantified ($ impact, FTE savings, project counts)
- **Storytelling**: Career progression shows 12-year growth trajectory
- **Social Proof**: Amazon testimonials establish credibility
- **Modern Tech**: AI/MCP/Agentic workflows position as innovator

### Technical Decisions
- **Static Export**: Chosen for speed, simplicity, GitHub Pages compatibility
- **Data-Driven**: `data.ts` as single source of truth for easy updates
- **Context API for Theme**: Simple, no external deps, persists to localStorage
- **Formspree**: Avoids backend complexity, good spam protection

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Component Structure Preference
```tsx
// Preferred pattern for sections:
<section id="section-name" className="w-full py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-32">
  <div className="container px-4 md:px-6 max-w-7xl mx-auto">
    <motion.h2 className="...gradient...">Section Title</motion.h2>
    {/* Content */}
  </div>
</section>
```

### Git Commit Style
- Descriptive, action-oriented messages
- Example: "Fix heading hierarchy: Add h1 tag to Hero name for proper SEO"
- Include "why" when it adds clarity

### CSS Variable Usage
- Always use HSL format for colors: `hsl(0 0% 93%)`
- Allows alpha channel: `hsl(var(--primary) / 0.5)`
- Better for theming than hex colors

## Learnings & Project Insights

### What Works Well
1. **Framer Motion** with `whileInView` creates polished scroll experience
2. **Data-driven approach** makes content updates trivial
3. **Tailwind utilities** keep styling consistent and fast
4. **Static export** ensures fast loading (< 3s on most connections)

### What to Watch
1. **Image sizes**: Keep project images optimized (use Next.js Image)
2. **Animation performance**: Too many simultaneous animations can lag
3. **Form spam**: Formspree has limits, monitor for abuse
4. **Content length**: Keep descriptions concise for scannability

### Best Practices Established
- Always test in both dark and light modes
- Run Lighthouse audit before major releases
- Test keyboard navigation after adding interactive elements
- Verify mobile responsiveness at 375px, 768px, 1920px
- Commit related changes together with descriptive messages

## Next Steps (Future Work)

### Content Maintenance
- Update resume PDF when revised
- Add new projects to `data.ts` as completed
- Update stats (FTE savings, project counts) quarterly
- Refresh testimonials if new ones received

### Potential Enhancements (Low Priority)
- Add project detail pages (would need routing solution for static export)
- Integrate blog (external platform like Medium, link in nav)
- Add downloadable case studies for key projects
- Create video demos for AI/automation projects
- Add analytics (Google Analytics or similar)

### Technical Debt (None Currently)
No significant technical debt. Code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices.
